A Next.js utility app I used to render over half a million images and place multi-font Urdu text on them in cursive format to create synthetic dataset for the training of a Text recognition model. The images were downloaded from the browser using a chrome extension to take snapshotsof the UI.

The dataset was used for a Masters project on Multi Font, CUrsive, Urdu Text Recognition using multiple Deep Learning algorithms like RCNNs, BiLSTMs and Transformers.
